# Installing pymoogo

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer.

## Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install pymoogo
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv add pymoogo
```

## Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pymoogo.git
cd pymoogo
uv sync
```

This installs the package with its development dependencies into a local virtual
environment.

## Verify the Installation

```bash
python -c "import pymoogo; print(pymoogo.__version__)"
```

You should see the installed version printed with no import errors.
